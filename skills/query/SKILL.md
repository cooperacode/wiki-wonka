# Skill: Query

You were invoked by the orchestrator because the user asked a question about the domain. Your job is to answer from the wiki — not from memory. Every claim in your answer must trace back to a wiki page, which traces back to a source in `raw/`.

Follow every step in order.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the question

Before opening any file, restate the question in your own words and identify:

- **Scope**: is this asking about a concept, an entity, a comparison, a contradiction, or an open question?
- **Expected wiki coverage**: based on `wiki/index.md`, do you expect this to be well-covered, partially covered, or potentially a gap?

Do not answer yet. Do not open wiki pages yet. Just think aloud in one short paragraph, then proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Find relevant pages

Read `wiki/index.md`. Identify every page that is likely relevant to the question. List them before opening any:

```
Relevant pages:
- concepts/self-attention (directly relevant)
- concepts/transformer (context)
- entities/vaswani-ashish (author context)
- sources/attention-is-all-you-need (primary source)
```

If `wiki/index.md` does not exist or is empty, tell the user the wiki has no content yet and stop. Suggest running an ingest first.

---

## Step 3 — Read the pages

Read each page from the list in Step 2. If a page links to other pages via `[[wikilinks]]` that seem relevant, follow those links too — but cap at 2 levels of depth to avoid sprawl.

As you read, track:

- Which pages have strong, direct answers.
- Which pages have partial or indirect answers.
- Where pages contradict each other (flagged with `> [!contradiction]`).
- What the wiki explicitly does not cover — genuine gaps, not just your knowledge.

Do not synthesize yet. Just read and take stock.

---

## Step 4 — Answer from the wiki

Write your answer. Rules:

**Cite every claim.** After each claim, reference the wiki page it came from using `[[wikilinks]]`. If a claim is supported by multiple pages, cite all of them.

```
Self-attention allows each token to attend to all others in the sequence
[[concepts/self-attention]], which differs from the recurrent approach
used in earlier architectures [[concepts/rnn]].
```

**Surface contradictions explicitly.** If wiki pages disagree on something relevant to the question, say so. Do not pick a side — report both positions and cite both pages.

```
Note: [[sources/paper-a]] and [[sources/paper-b]] disagree on whether
this scales to sequences longer than 4096 tokens. This is an open
tension in the wiki.
```

**Flag gaps honestly.** If the wiki does not cover something relevant to the question, say so explicitly rather than filling in from memory.

```
The wiki does not yet have coverage on mixture-of-experts variants.
Consider ingesting a source on this if it is relevant to your work.
```

**Do not hallucinate sources.** If you are tempted to cite something not in the wiki, do not. Write "not in wiki" instead.

**Length:** match the depth of the question. A factual lookup gets a paragraph. A synthesis question gets structured sections. A comparison question gets a side-by-side if useful.

---

## Step 5 — Offer to file the answer

After answering, ask:

```
Want me to save this as a wiki page?
```

If the user says yes, ask for a title if not obvious, then create `wiki/concepts/<slug>.md` using the concept page template from `skills/ingest/SKILL.md`. The page should contain the synthesized answer, with all citations intact, plus a `## Source question` section at the top:

```markdown
## Source question

> "Original question the user asked"
> Filed: YYYY-MM-DD
```

Then update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | Original question

Answer filed as: concepts/slug
Pages read: concepts/x, concepts/y, sources/z (N total)
Gaps identified: 1 (mixture-of-experts not covered)
```

If the user says no, log anyway without the "filed as" line.

---

## Step 6 — Suggest follow-up actions

After answering (and filing if applicable), offer one of the following if relevant — not all of them:

- A related question the wiki could answer well right now.
- A gap worth filling via ingest (name a specific type of source, not vague "more research").
- A lint opportunity if you noticed contradictions or orphaned pages while reading.

One suggestion max. Do not pad.

---

## Rules

- **Never answer from memory alone.** If no wiki page covers the topic, say so and stop. The wiki is the source of truth, not your training data.
- **Never open files in `raw/`.** Query operates only on `wiki/`. If the user wants raw source content, suggest ingest.
- **Never modify wiki pages while answering**, except when explicitly filing the answer in Step 5. Reading is read-only.
- **Never invent wiki pages.** If you reference a page that does not exist in `wiki/index.md`, correct yourself.
- **If the index is large** (100+ pages), do not read every page — use the index categories and page summaries to narrow down before opening files.
- **If the question is ambiguous**, ask one clarifying question before proceeding to Step 2. One question, not a list.
